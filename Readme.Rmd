# Introduction

This project represents the current pre-release and actively developed comprehensive RNA-seq analysis pipeline used at the Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory. It is a work in progress. The goal is to document the tools and workflows that our analysts currently use, make them portable and share with the community.
  
Modules (i.e. workflow collections) include *Alignment and QC*, *Differential Expression*, *Fusions (with concordance to WGS data)*, *miRNA*, and *RNA Variant Calling*.

Tools will be described in the common workflow language and have have associated docker images hosted in the cgrlab docker registry. CWL and Docker are not a requirement to run any of the workflows.
Portability will demonstrated by using several framework/executors depending on the environment. Potential options include Rabix, Toil, SevenBridges, SnakeMake...etc.




# Alignment and QC

## STAR Alignment Workflows

```{r child = '~/cgrRNA/modules/alignment_and_qc/star_alignment/Readme.Rmd'}
```


# Fusions

## Data harmonization

### File naming conventions

All fusion output files follow the same naming schema which is the concatenation of the Sample ID, Fusion tool name, and then file extension.
 
e.g. SA01234_chimerascan_output.bedpe, SA01234_ericscript_output.txt
 
All files will be tab delimited.

## Fusion Finders

### Chimerascan

```{r child = '~/cgrRNA/modules/fusions/chimerascan/Readme.Rmd'}
```

### EricScript

```{r child = '~/cgrRNA/modules/fusions/ericscript/Readme.Rmd'}
```

### Mapsplice
